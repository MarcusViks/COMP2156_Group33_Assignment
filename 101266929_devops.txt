# Information about COMP 2156

Our course, COMP2156, teaches us many things about DevOps.


The course will allow us to:

- knowledge of strategies such as CI/CD

- Understanding of Cloud database technologies

- Automating configurations and operations

- Version control system workdflows

- integrating security practices into the development cycle.


While our course is fully online, it still allows us to learn the basics of DevOps.

Being able to use Git, CLI, GitHub, and CI/CD is not only important for DevOps,
but it is also important for many other CS related jobs/tasks.

While we are already half way through the semester, I am still excited to learn all there is to know about DevOps.
